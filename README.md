# Book_Portal_Assignment2
The Book Portal is a JavaScript-based app that simulates a bookstore. Users can view available books, add books to their cart, and view/update the cart. The app supports adding books by quantity, calculating total cart value, and updating cart items (increase, decrease, or remove). It ensures stock availability for each operation.
